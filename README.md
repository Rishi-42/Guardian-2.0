# Guardian-2.0

As I approach the end of my undergraduate journey, I have decided to rebuild my "[Final Year Project](https://github.com/Rishi-42/Guardain-1.0)" into its best possible version. Over time, I realized I never fully committed to this goal, but today marks the day I will start the process of re-creating it from scratch.

In this project, I will be developing the endpoints based on the requirements I outlined back in 2022.

If you're reading this, I'm excited to hear any comments, suggestions, or recommendations you may have!
